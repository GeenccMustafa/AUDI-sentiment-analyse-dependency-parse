# AUDI Sentiment Analyse Dependency Parse

## Description
This project contains two Jupyter Notebook files:
- **6_Dependency_parse.ipynb**
- **7_Sentiment_Analyse.ipynb**

## 6_Dependency_parse.ipynb
This notebook includes code for analyzing text data using dependency parsing. It performs the following tasks:
- Loading datasets and libraries
- Getting the dependency parse of sentences
- Visualizing top roots and verbs in the reviews text after lemmatization
- Extracting adverbs, adjectives, nouns, and conjunctions from the reviews text after lemmatization
- Visualizing top adverbs, adjectives, nouns, and conjunctions in the reviews text after lemmatization
